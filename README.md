# LogisticDashboard
This mobile dashboard helps logistics managers monitor and track shipment status, driver activity, and delivery KPIs efficiently. Built using React Native, it leverages Redux for state management, uses mock data to simulate real-time behavior, and includes modular components for maintainability and scalability.
