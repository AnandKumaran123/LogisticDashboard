/**
 *configureStore: This is Redux Toolkitâ€™s method that wraps createStore, handles the default middleware (including redux-thunk), and integrates well with Redux DevTools.
 *rootReducer: Instead of combineReducers, you pass an object of reducers, which configureStore handles internally.
 *middleware: getDefaultMiddleware() includes essential middleware like redux-thunk. You can extend it by concatenating custom middleware like redux-logger.
*This approach simplifies the process compared to manually configuring everything with createStore.
